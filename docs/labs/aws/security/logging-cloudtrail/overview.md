# AWS CloudTrail Logging & Audit Visibility

## Problem
Without centralized audit logging, security teams cannot determine
who did what, when, or from where inside an AWS environment.

## Why It Matters
CloudTrail is foundational for:
- Incident response
- Compliance audits
- Threat detection
- Zero Trust observability

Lack of CloudTrail visibility is a common root cause in delayed breach detection.

## What You Will Learn
- How AWS CloudTrail records API activity
- The difference between management and data events
- How CloudTrail integrates with S3 and CloudWatch

## Real-World Context
CloudTrail logs are routinely reviewed during security investigations
and are required controls in regulated environments.
