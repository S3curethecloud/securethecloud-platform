# Secure Network Access (Composite)

## Problem
Direct public access to internal resources increases attack surface
and enables lateral movement.

## Why It Matters
Secure access patterns combine identity-aware access with network
segmentation to reduce exposure.

## What You Will Learn
- How to restrict access using layered controls
- How identity and network controls complement each other
- How to validate secure access paths

## Real-World Context
Modern architectures rely on private access, bastions, and identity-aware
entry points rather than open networks.
